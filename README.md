# Shalion Technical Challenge

This test was made with Create react app.

## Installation & Usage.

To run development mode:

```
To Install repo:
npm install.
npm start
```

To run build: in the ~directory run the following.

```
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
```

Nice to have:

```
- Add better select component -> react-select.
- Test -> Jest, Cypress.
- Add Filter by Date.
- Improve filters -> Plot chart
- Match colors of charts with retailers.
```
